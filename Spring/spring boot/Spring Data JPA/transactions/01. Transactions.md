1. A @transactional method call must always be made a another bean
2. @Transactional transactions work on AOP, if the method call does not originate in another bean it doesnt cross the proxy object boundary, and transaction doesnt work
```java
@Service
public SomeService {
	
	public void barter(Money amount, Account from, Account to){
		transfer();
	}
	
	@Transactional
	public void transfer(Money amount, Account from, Account to){
	
	}
}
```

the above example doesnt work

we need to call the transfer method from another bean or it to work
# and since @transactional works on AOP the method needs to be public?

# if @transactional is applied at the class level only the public methods are actually transactional
