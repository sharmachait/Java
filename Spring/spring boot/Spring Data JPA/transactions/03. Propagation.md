## How are transactions handled in nested transactions

### based on the Propagation value

#### the default value is REQUIRED
this creates a new transaction if necessary, if the calling method already is executing in a transaction then no new transaction
```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
```
#### REQUIRES_NEW
it doesnt matter if the calling method is in transaction or not, a new one will be created
#### SUPPORTS
if the calling method is in a transaction then it will also use that same transactional context, otherwise no
#### MANDATORY
the calling method must necessarily be in transaction other wise throws exception, uses the parent transaction
#### NEVER
if the calling method is in transaction throws error, must never be called in a transactional context
