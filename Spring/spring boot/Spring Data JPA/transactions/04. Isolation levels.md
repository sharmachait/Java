takes care of how changes are seen by other parallel transactions

```java
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED)
```

1. READ_UNCOMMITTED - Lowest Isolation level, Reads are not consistent, but may avoid additional database locks, but suffers from dirty read nonrepeatable read and phantom reads of new records
	1. POSTGRES DOESNT SUPPORT
2. READ_COMMITTED -  all the reads in our transaction will receive a fresh snapshot of the data
3. REPEATABLE_READ - GOOD TO USE
	- Your transaction receives a consistent view of the database at the time the first read operation occurs
	- This view remains consistent throughout your transaction, even if other transactions commit changes
	- Your transaction effectively works with a snapshot of the data taken at the start of the transaction
	- doesnt allow simultaneous access to a row to multiple transactions
4. SERIALIZABLE - has the same effect as running the transactions in a serial order
