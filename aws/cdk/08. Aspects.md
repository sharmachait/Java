Allow us to check or modify resources after they are created
Aspects implement the visitor pattern. which means it will visit all our resources and run the visit method
Simple use case: adding tags to resources
Popular use case: enforce security/best practices

## Adding tags with Aspects
```ts
import {IAspect} from "aws-cdk-lib";  
import {IConstruct} from "constructs";  
import {CfnBucket} from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";  
  
export class BucketTagger implements IAspect {  
    private key: string;  
    private value: string;  
	
    constructor(key: string, value:string) {  
        this.key = key;  
        this.value = value;  
    }  
    visit(node: IConstruct): void {  
        if(node instanceof CfnBucket) {  
            node.tags.setTag(this.key, this.value)  
        }    
    }
}
```

the visit method will be called on all the resources that we are creating 

the visit method is called for all resources during synth, so it will run for all, not just the ones we are deploying
but before that we also need to register it in the entrypoint of our application
```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node  
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';  
import {PhotosStack} from "../lib/PhotosStack";  
import {PhotosHandlerStack} from "../lib/PhotosHandlerStack";  
import {BucketTagger} from "./BucketTagger";  
  
const app = new cdk.App();   
const photoStack = new PhotosStack(app, 'PhotosStack');  
new PhotosHandlerStack(app, 'PhotosHandlerStack',{targetBucketArn: photoStack.bucketArn});  
  
const tagger = new BucketTagger("level", "testvalue");  
cdk.Aspects.of(app).add(tagger);
```
## enforcing security/best practices
use cdk-nag library for pre defined aspects
