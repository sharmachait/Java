Concurrency is achieved with Time Slicing algorithm to give each task a fair chance to run

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Thread thread = new Thread();
		thread.start();
	}
}
```
this examples starts and stops the other thread immediately
## to run some code in another thread we have 3 options
#### extending Thread class
```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		MyThread thread = new MyThread();
		thread.start();
	}
	static class MyThread extends Thread {
		@Override
		public void run(){
			System.out.println("my thread");
		}
	}
}
```
#### implementing runnable interface
better way
```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
		thread.start();
	}
	static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
		@Override
		public void run(){
			System.out.println("my thread");
		}
	}
}
```

#### lambda expression best way
```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Runnable runnable = () -> {
			System.out.println("my thread");
		};
		Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
		thread.start();
	}
}
```

# the .start() is non blocking

# if we want the calling thread to be blocked at some point by a thread do thread.join()

## accessing the current thread
![[Pasted image 20240908130348.png]]
this gets us the current thread that is running the runnable
if we do it out in the main method we get the main thread
we can give names to thread at the time of creation in the constructor

## Stopping a thread execution
```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		MyRunnable stoppable = new MyRunnable();
		Thread thread = new Thread(stoppable);
		thread.start();
		try{
			Thread.sleep(5000);
		}catch(InterruptedException e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		stoppable.requestStop();
	}
	static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
		private boolean stop = false;
		public synchronized void requestStop(){ this.stop = true; }
		public synchronized boolean isStopRequested(){ return this.stop; }
		private void sleep(long millis){
			try{
				Thread.sleep(millis);
			}catch(InterruptedException e){
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
		@Override
		public void run(){
			System.out.println("my thread");
			while(!isStopRequested()){
				sleep(1000);
				System.out.println(".......");
			}
			System.out.println("stopping");
		}
	}
}
```

JVM stays alive as long as there is atleast one thred that is till running, it doesnt have to be the main thread

if you dont want a secondary thread to keep the JVM alive we must set it as a daemon thread
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
thread.setDaemon(true);
```

## Join
we can make the main thread to wait for the threads with join
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
thread.join();
```

These are all OS level threads and are heavy to create and shutdown

## Memory model
each thread has its own thread stack and the heap is shared across the threads

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
		Thread thread1 = new Thread(runnable);
		Thread thread2 = new Thread(runnable);
		thread1.start();
		thread2.start();
	}
	static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
		private int count;
		//private MyObject obj;
		@Override
		public void run(){
		//	this.obj = new MyObject();
			for(int i=0; i< 100_00;i++){
				this.count++;
			}
			System.out.println(this.count);
		}
	}
}
```

in the above example each thread has its own `i` variable but the same `count` as they are using the same runnable
if we were to use two runnable objects then they would be referencing different variables
