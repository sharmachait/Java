Not all fields need to be declared volatile, one is enough all other i the same scope as the volatile variables are refreshed and flushed from and to the main memory

![[Pasted image 20250608230513.png]]

all variables in scope are also refreshed from the main memory when thread enters a synchronized block
# synchronized
block of java code that can only be executed by a single thread at a time
in a synchronized block all the variables that are in scope are refreshed from the main memory into the thread cache


#### Static synchronized class
```java
public class SynchronizedExchanger {

	private static Object syncField = null;
	
	public static void setField(Object o){
		synchronized(SynchronizedExchanger.class){
			SynchronizedExchanger.syncField = o;
		}
	}
	
	public static Object getField(){
		synchronized(SynchronizedExchanger.class){
			return SynchronizedExchanger.syncField;
		}
	}
	
	public static synchronized void setF(Object o){
		SynchronizedExchanger.syncField = o;
	}
	
	public static synchronized Object getF(){
		return SynchronizedExchanger.syncField;
	}
}
```

#### Singleton synchronized objects
If you create two objects (instances) of the SynchronizedExchanger class and use them in two different threads, the synchronization will NOT occur between the two threads, because each thread will be working with a separate object and, therefore, a separate lock.
and so it should ne a singleton with thread safety
```java
public class SynchronizedExchanger {
	
	private static volatile SynchronizedExchanger instance;
	private SynchronizedExchanger() {}
	public static SynchronizedExchanger getInstance() { 
		if (instance == null) { // checks thread cache for object
			synchronized (SynchronizedExchanger.class) { // refreshes thread cache from main memory
				if (instance == null) { // recheck if still null
					instance = new SynchronizedExchanger(); 
				} 
			} 
		} 
		return instance; 
	}
	
	protected Object object = null;
	
	public synchronized void setObject(Object o){
		this.object = o;
	}
	
	public synchronized Object getObject(){
		return this.object;
	}
	
	public void setObj(Object o){
		synchronized(this){
			this.object = o;
		}
	}
	
	public Object getObj(){
		synchronized(this){
			return this.object;
		}
	}
}
```

#### Synchronize on a lock object
```java
public class SynchronizedExchanger {

	private static Object lock = new Object();
	protected Object object = null;
	
	public void setObj(Object o){
		synchronized(SynchronizedExchanger.lock){
			this.object = o;
		}
	}
	
	public Object getObj(){
		synchronized(SynchronizedExchanger.lock){
			return this.object;
		}
	}
}
```

#### Sharing monitor objects
its possible to pass an object as a monitor to different threads
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object monitor = new Object();
		int c[] = new int[1];
		SharedMonitorObject a = new SharedMonitorObject(monitor,c);
		SharedMonitorObject b = new SharedMonitorObject(monitor,c);
		
		CompletableFuture<Void> f1 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(()->{
			for(int i=0; i< 1000; i++){
				a.incCounter();
			}
		});
		CompletableFuture<Void> f2 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(()->{
			for(int i=0; i< 1000; i++){
				b.incCounter();
			}
		});
		f1.join();
		f2.join();
        System.out.println(c[0]);
    }
}

class SharedMonitorObject {
	private Object monitor = null;
	public int[] counter = null;
	public SharedMonitorObject(Object o, int[] c){
		if(o==null)
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Monitor object can not be null");
		this.monitor = o;
		this.counter = c;
	}
	public void incCounter(){
		synchronized(this.monitor) {
			this.counter[0]++;
		}
	}
}
```
now it would be safe to create two different objects of this class in different threads the incCounter would still be synchronized

## Synchronized blocks are reentrant
it means we can call another synchronized method from a synchronized method and control flow wont be blocked

```java
public class Reentrant {
	int c=0;
	
	public synchronized void inc(){
		this.c++;
	}
	
	public synchronized int incAndGet(){
		inc();
		return this.c;
	}
}
```

a call to inc and Get goes into inc as well control flow is hopping between synchronized blocks

## Limitations
- blocks other threads from reading as well, can be done with reentrant locks like in jedis
- no guarantee about the sequence in which waiting threads get access

# Volatile
when a variable is declared volatile it tells jvm to read and write that variable directly to main memory instead of the thread cache
without volatile we can not guarantee when and how many times a variable will be refreshed from main memory
```java
public class Exchanger {
	private Object object = null;
	private volatile boolean hasNewObject = false;
	public void setObj(Object o){
		this.object = o;
		this.hasNewObject = true;
	}
	public Object getObject(){
		while(!this.hasNewObject){
			// busy wait
		}
		Object returnValue = this.object;
		this.hasNewObject = false;
		return returnValue;
	}
}
```

when we make one variable volatile all variables that are part of the scope are written to the main memory
so we should not update volatile variable first it should be updated last so that it takes all the cached values with it to main memory, if we update a non volatile variable after the volatile variable it wont go down to the main memory
same is true for reads, when we read a volatile variable the thread refreshes all the caches from the main memory so it should be read first before any other variable is read. if we read a variable before reading the volatile variable its read from the cache not the main memory

## Limitations
volatile alone isnt enough
```java
public class Counter {
	public volatile int count = 0;
	public boolean inc(){
		if(this.count==10)
			return false;
		this.count++;
		return true;
	}
}
```
its possible for two threads to concurrently check this.count to be 9 and then both of them increment it resulting in 11
another issue is that the increment operation is not atomic itself
