when JVM creates a virtual threads its not mounted to a platform thread
in case a virtual thread is blocked due to some IO or network call, it is unmounted from the platform thread and queued up for execution, in the meantime the platform thread that was freed up can execute another virtual thread that was waiting to be executed

```java
Thread vThreadStarted = Thread.ofVirtual().start(runnable); 
//immediately started
Thread vThreadNotStarted = Thread.ofVirtual().unstarted(runnable);
//not started immediately
vThreadNotStarted.start();

//its possible to join a thread once it is started with
vThreadNotStarted.join();
```
