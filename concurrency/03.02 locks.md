## Locks
why needed if we have synchronized 
allows interrupting threads waiting for a lock
```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true);// true makes the lock fair for all threads

Thread worker = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        lock.lockInterruptibly(); // Waits, but interruptible
        try {
            // Critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("Thread interrupted while waiting!");
    }
});

lock.lock(); // Main thread holds lock
worker.start();
Thread.sleep(1000);
worker.interrupt(); // Interrupts waiting thread

```
You can query a `ReentrantLock` to check if it is locked, which thread holds it, or get a list of threads waiting for it.

The term "reentrant" in "reentrant lock" refers to the lock's ability to be acquired multiple times by the same thread without causing a deadlock.

unlock should happen in a finally block

Same thread can lock a reentrant lock again and again
if a thread locks a lock 3 times it should be unlocked 3 times before another thread can lock it
