If i am being hired for Groceries, is this job role open because the team is growing as per standard, or if this job opening is in response to some new project that the team would be under taking?

i imagine groceries inventory management to be different from the regular inventory management, so does the team work on that or do we use some standard Inventory management system with some tweaks

are there any pitfalls the new recruits generally fall into? 

whats the best thing you like about working in your team?



Depth along with breadth is important, soif i plan to have a long career how is changing roles / teams or verticals treated in amazon

are there any tough decisions that would be required after this hiring process that i would need to be prepared for in the first 2-3 months of joining

i have a youtube channel i make videos on stuff like build your redis, i have a few ideas panned out for future as well, does this cause a conflict on interest? or is it frowned upon ?
